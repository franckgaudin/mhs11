I’ve consumed a lot of Beatles-related media, and this book is the closest to a relatable version of the Story as I’ve found. It does an especially good job of proving the Beatles relevant to 2018.

Ancillary benefit: it’s just really good music writing. We’ve all read a lot of bad music writing in our lives, so you understand why this is a big deal.
