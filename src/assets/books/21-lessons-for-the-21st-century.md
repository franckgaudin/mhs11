This one wasn't as good as _Sapiens_, but was enjoyable nonetheless. Here's one of my favorite passages:

> Humans were always far better at inventing tools than using them wisely. It is easier to manipulate a river by building a dam than it is to predict all the complex consequences this will have for the wider ecological system. Similarly, it will be easier to redirect the flow of our minds than to divine what that will do to our personal psychology or to our social systems.
