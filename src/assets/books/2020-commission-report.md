Hoo boy. I haven’t read much speculative fiction — the _Earthseed_ Series is probably as close as I’ve come lately — but I picked this up on a strong recommendation from _Sourdough_ author Robin Sloan.

The 2020 Report is formatted as a congressional report following … you guessed it … a nuclear strike against the US by North Korea. The actions that it describes are simultaneously absurd and realistic: for instance, the president’s tweets are a major macguffin. Something about the matter-of-factness of the writing, combined with the ludicrous characters involved, really shook me.

The book itself is a quick read. I blew through it in a week or so of intense reading; it’s quite a page-turner. Highly recommended if you enjoy staring deep into the existential dread of the Trump presidency.
