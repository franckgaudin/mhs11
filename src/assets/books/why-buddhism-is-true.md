This was one of my favorite reads in a long time. In it, Wright connects some of the ideas and practices of modern/secular/Western Buddhism to the science of well-being. His writing is straightforward and crystal-clear. He connects his ideas to his own meditation practice, which in turn helped me continue my own practice.

The downside to Wright’s version of Buddhism is that it is narrow and personalized to the author’s experience as a Westerner. To me, part of the appeal of Buddhism is in its mystery, the fundamentally non-intuitive parts, the deftness with which it transcends Western logic and orderliness.
