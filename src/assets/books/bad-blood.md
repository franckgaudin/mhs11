This one’s a really good page-turner. It follows the course of Theranos from being a twinkle in Elizabeth Holmes’ eye all the way up to early 2018. It is **amazing** just how much deception and fraud was going on at the highest levels of this company, and how so many people were willing to turn a blind eye to it. Carreyrou’s writing is super straightforward, and while he is a player in the story, he comes across pretty impartial in the whole matter.

Bonus: you’ll get the Taylor Swift song stuck in your head every time you read.
