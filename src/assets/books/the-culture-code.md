Sorry to disappoint, this is not in any way related to Dan Brown’s seminal 2003 masterwork The Da Vinci Code.

Instead, it’s a solid survey of how culture factors into a team’s performance. Nothing really earth-shattering; just a straightforward, real-world discussion of why team culture matters. Coyle spends each section on a few of the usual suspects — Navy SEALS, jewel thieves, Tony Hsieh — and breaks down different aspects (performance, creativity, how many catchphrases they use) of each team.

While there’s a bit of survivorship bias going on here (somehow the Dutch East Indies Company never makes it into these books), there were some really nice actionable takeaways.

Highly recommended for management buddies.
