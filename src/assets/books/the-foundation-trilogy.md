It won the Hugo Award for “Best All-Time Series” in 1966, so I figured I’d give it a read. Boy howdy, is it a good science fiction.

If you’ve read Three Body Problem, you’ll get a lot of the same themes: lots of logic twists and loops, lots of time and space covered. The characters that Asimov creates are super-neat, though; they have a lot of depth to them, even when he spins one up for a chapter or two.

You can sense the author’s interest in the series waxing and waning throughout, but even at it’s most “etc etc stuff happened etc etc” it’s a nice read. When it really clips, it’s un-put-down-able.
