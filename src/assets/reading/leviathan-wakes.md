I tried to get Sasha to watch the TV show with me, but failed. So I started to read the book instead. I haven't read any more of the 'Expanse' series, so it's difficult to assess where the hype comes from. In part, I think it's a blending of genres; there's the typical science fiction bent, but there's also a bit of noir, and a dash of post-apocalyptic distopia. 

The whole book revolves around a mystery. Oddly, the mystery is solved at the end of the second act. This means the ending of the book feels like a foregone conclusion.
