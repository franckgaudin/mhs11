It's hard to overstate the value of understanding bias. This book is a must-read: Kahneman has such a talent for unraveling the counter-intuitive nature of bias, heuristics, and the way people make decisions. His research with Amos Tversky (called _prosepect theory_) has influenced economics in ways I can't understand, but the effect is recognizable when you book a hotel online (scarcity bias at play) or check out on Amazon.

The sections of the book on expert intuition were especially relevant at the time I read them, and helped me to write an essay called [Intuition vs. Data](/writing/intuition/).
