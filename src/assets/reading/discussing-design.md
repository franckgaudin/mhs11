This book is a good collection of techniques to improve creative feedback. I've used a lot of them since reading it. My favorites:

1. **Critique to improve, not critique to approve.** Remind stakeholders that their role isn't to say 'yes' or 'no,' rather to give the designer actionable feedback for how to resolve any critical issues.
2. **Incremental vs. iterative** - We often call work iterative when it's actually incremental. That is: we don't actually build a full usable version of a product, release it, and then progressively improve it. We start with an unusuable thing, and then slowly build it up until it's in a largely finished state. Being able to make this distinction helps to set expectations and get the right kind of feedback.
3. **[Six thinking hats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Thinking_Hats)** - A good exercise to increase the quality and diversity of feedback is to assign 'hats' to participants which guide the kind of feedback they're expected to give.
