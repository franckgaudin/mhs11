A weird book. Weird, in the ways that weird can be: unusual, unfamiliar, unsettling. I'd read VanderMeer's _Annihilation,_ and really enjoyed the tension created by characters struggling to grapple with the unwinding reality they find themselves in. For _Borne,_ you're the one who is grappling with a totally unwound reality.

The world of _Borne_ is presented as-is, and it took me a good half the book to get comfortable with some of the upended expectations of typical sci-fi creation. Example: one of the macguffins (if you can call it that) is a skyscraper-sized bear named Mord. Mord can fly.

But once I stopped dwelling on the absurdity, I really liked how things unfolded. It's a book like no other, for better or worse.
