I picked this up looking for a break after reading a few heavy non-fiction titles. It delivered exactly that: an entertaining read with enough science to keep my brain busy. Specifically, the book includes some ideas from epidemiology, as its heroes have day jobs in agencies like the Centers for Disease Control. The conclusion of the book strays a little bit too far into Dan Brown conspiracy fodder, which means it was ultimately pretty forgettable.
