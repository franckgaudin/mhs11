_Good Services_ is a straightforward, to-the-point guide to designing services to provide the best outcomes for their users. The book is structured around 15 principles for service design; the author, Lou Downe, developed the principles in practice as the pioneer of service design in the UK government. This approach led [UK.gov](https://www.gov.uk/) to be the standard of excellence by which all government services websites are measured.

Bonus: the book is very well designed. I read mostly on a Kindle these days, so it's nice to spend some time with a really solid piece of paper and ink.
