This is a very good book about writing. Not just about the form of writing, or the action of writing. It's also about why we write, what is so challenging about writing, and what makes good writing good.

After reading the fist half, I found it really hard to write. The book advocates for a style of writing where every single word in every single sentence has a purpose. It is extremely difficult to actually do this.

One of my favorite excerpts:

> The most subversive thing you can do is to write clearly and directly, Asserting the facts as you understand them, Your perceptions as youâ€™ve gathered them.
