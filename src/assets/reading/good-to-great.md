A decent overview of some of the strategies that companies have taken to accelerate their growth and achieve success. Includes some interesting case studies of companies like Fannie Mae, Circuit City, and Wells Fargo; however, given the fact that all those companies eventually found themselves in hot water, it's easy to call Collins' assessment into question.

Level Five Leadership, Hedgehog vs. Fox, the Stockdale Paradox, all of these are good mental models to apply to business. All of them are easy to Google, and I'd reckon that's just as good as reading this book.
