After reading and enjoying [_Recursion_](/reading/recursion), I decided to give _Dark Matter_ a shot. It has many of the same hallmarks; twisting labyrinths of plotlines woken together by a central technological concept, creating tension for the main characters in incredibly personal ways. I think _Recursion_ is the better book, though. _Dark Matter_'s main character is a little flat, and his physical relationship with his wife is a little too commonly exploited for plot padding. Overall, a solid breezy read, but nothing quite as memorable as the most recent incarnation.
