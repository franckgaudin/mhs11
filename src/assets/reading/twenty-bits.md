I've been reading a lot more real, physical books during the lockdown. When I saw Dan Cederholm's new book was available, it was an instant purchase.

Dan is a serial entrepreneur and creative force of nature. He's been writing about web design and development for as long as I've been practicing, and his contributions to and general presence in the community has always been a good influence on me. "Twenty Bits" is a snack-sized distillation of Dan's wisdom. It really resonated with me — Dan's words on starting a partnership, launching a product, all while being patient and resilient, once again formed a great impression.

Bonus: the book is a delight to hold. You can buy it directly from Dan on [his website](https://simplebits.com/).
