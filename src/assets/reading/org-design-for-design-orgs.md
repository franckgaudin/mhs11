I read this after my design team at Bitly was re-organized into a decentralized structure. I personally preferred being in a centralized org, so I thought I'd try and read a bit to understand why a decentralized org might make sense.

The biggest takeaway from this book is its articulation of the Centralized Partnership model (you can read the chapter on this model on [O'Reilly's Website](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/org-design-for/9781491938393/ch04.html)). It's exactly what I think most design orgs should be: centralized to provide designers with a sense of community and career development, but always partnered with other parts of the organization to deliver business outcomes. Essentially: there is no design in a vacuum.
