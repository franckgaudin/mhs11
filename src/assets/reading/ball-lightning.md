*Three-Body Problem* was one of my favorite reads of 2017. The scope of the trilogy, the twists and turns of logic and narrative, the unique perspective of the author; *Three-Body Problem* had everything I love in hard science fiction. I went into *Ball Lightning* expecting the same experience, or maybe something close to it. I was a little disappointed.

What I like most about hard sci-fi is that it doesn't lean on suspension of disbelief as much as other genres of sci-fi and fantasy. *Ball Lightning* has a lot of hand-waving moments that skirt the constraints of reality, making it harder for to be invests in the characters or the world Cixin builds.
