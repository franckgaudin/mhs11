I'm constantly trying to improve the way I work with stakeholders. Feedback is the lifeblood of great design: when you see great design in the world, it's a product of a group of people that agreed to deliver that design. Seldom is a single designer left alone to make all the decisions.

The author spends a lot of the book setting the scene for a meeting where design is critiqued and feedback is generated. I think that we're going to quickly lose this model of design feedback. Agile working styles demand that designers deliver faster and faster, so asynchronous feedback will become the new norm. There are a few ideas from the book that can be taken into the new async world, but most will have to be left behind.
