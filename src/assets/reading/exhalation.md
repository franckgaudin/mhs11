Black Mirror x Borges — great short stories that explore some traditionally sci-fi concepts from more of a prodding, philosophical standpoint. The best part about Chiang's stories are the feels ... instead of being Borges-style think pieces, you get lots of emotional depth. Especially with the parrot.
