                <p>
                    The Wall Street Journal is one of the world’s most trusted sources of news, and the homepage of wsj.com is the face of the Journal. This single page is read by more than half a million people every day. It is continuously curated, updated minute-by-minute to reflect the rapidly evolving news landscape. In 2018, it needed its own evolution.

    <h2>The role of the homepage</h2>
    <p>
        Before the rise of social media and powerful search engines, the homepage used to be the most important page on a website. Homepages served as directories, discovery engines and brand marquees. But in the past decade, the homepage's purpose has changed. It's no longer the primary platform of discovery; many people read the Wall Street Journal without ever seeing the homepage.
    </p>
    <p>
        In response to this shift, the editors of the Wall Street Journal wanted to begin exploring how the homepage can be a standalone news-reading experience. The goal was to provide a snapshot of the news that could quickly adapt to the minute-by-minute coverage the Journal provided. The homepage would not only need to change to reflect the news, but also accomodate a wide variety of reading behaviors, advertising needs, and business goals.

    </figure>
    <p>
        The editors of the Journal also wanted to introduce features to the homepage that built on existing brand equity. For instance, the front page "What's News" column is one of the most recognizable elements of the newspaper: short bullet-style snippets that provide an overview of all the day's business and finance news. Part of my team's goals was to build a system that would support these new features.

        <h2>Modernizing the Journal's typography</h2>
        <p>
            The Wall Street Journal has a long history of quality typography. There’s a wealth of design wisdom behind the paper’s current look, as the evolution of news design is encoded in each page.
        </p>

    <h2>A programming language for design</h2>
    <p>
        Tools can make or break a project. Working with the journalists at the Journal, I discovered that traditional design tools wouldn't do; the news changes too fast and is too unpredictable to be constrained by static elements in a Sketch file.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead, I created a software tool — called the homepage sandbox — to enable designers, developers, and journalists to collaborate on the design of the homepage. This effort paid off, and the partnership between stakeholders allowed designers to iterate quickly and explore more broadly.

    </div>
    <p>
        The homepage sandbox pulled data in real time from the Journal's content APIs. It formatted story data into a simple structue that editors, designers, and engineers could read and edit.

        The sandbox allowed users to define layouts using plain text, making it easy to quickly try new variations and combinations.

        The software outputs static html which could be easily shared or hosted online, giving the team a way of sharing ideas without relying on proprietary file formats or specialized software.

            To differentiate video content from article content, the team introduced a dark theme for cards. By carefully defining the basic building blocks of the page, we opened the door to these expressive theme options.

    <h2>Putting it all together</h2>
    <p>Having a robust set of design tools allowed an unprecedented level of coordination between designers, developers, and editors for the Wall Street Journal's homepage. The resulting collaboration has given the homepage a new life as a uniquely valuable news reading experience.</p>

        <figcaption>Editors often wanted to create "packages," groups of stories that shared a thematic and newsworthy subject. Cards could be reconfigured on-the-fly to accomodate complex layouts and hierarhies.</figcaption>

    <p>As of 2019, the wsj.com was rolling out the result of this work in an iterative, continuous fashion.
