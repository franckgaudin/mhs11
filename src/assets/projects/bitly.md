                    When I joined Bitly in 2018, the company was at the beginning of a transformation. The team that had built Bitly was looking for a design leader to help their products make the leap from scrappy startup to enterprise-grade SaaS platform. Throughout my time there, I led a number of projects to support this journey, propelling growth while maintaining a vibrant brand. A year later, Bitly is a multi-channel business, securing deals with Fortune 50 companies, while continuing to be the world's most popular free link shortener.

    <h2>In the beginning</h2>
    <p>In 2018, Bitly turned 10 years old. The previous year, the private equity group Spectrum Equity had invested $63 million into the company to help it grow into a powerful enterprise SaaS platform. I joined a small but scrappy design team, and we set about taking inventory of what design could do to achieve Bitly's mission.</p>

    <p>The homepage of the site, along with all of the marketing materials, hadn't been updated in years. Bitly's products, including a web application, mobile apps, and browser extensions, were suffering from tech debt and the lack of a comprehensive design system. The design team itself had grown 4x and needed new processes and cultural tools to help its growth and maturity.</p>

    <p>Design principles are an integral part of scaling the design process. Bitly was on track to double its head count, and so we needed to pave the way to alignment and collaboration between design and the rest of the company.</p>

    <p>To quickly generate a set of design principles with the team, I facilitated a number of <a href="/writing/design-principles-workshop/" target="_blank">1-hour design principles workshops</a>. These workshops are designed to allow a large number of cross-functional teammates to efficiently generate, group, and decide on principles. At the end of the workshops, we had a total of 81 possible principles grouped into 12 themes.</p>

    <p>We refined the 81 principles into 6 based on multiple rounds of editing and dot voting. I worked with my design colleague Lizzie May to create a poster for each principle.</p>
