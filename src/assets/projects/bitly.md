                    When I joined Bitly in 2018, the company was at the beginning of a transformation. The team that had built Bitly was looking for a design leader to help their products make the leap from scrappy startup to enterprise-grade SaaS platform. Throughout my time there, I led a number of projects to support this journey, propelling growth while maintaining a vibrant brand. A year later, Bitly is a multi-channel business, securing deals with Fortune 50 companies, while continuing to be the world's most popular free link shortener.

    <h2>In the beginning</h2>
    <p>In 2018, Bitly turned 10 years old. The previous year, the private equity group Spectrum Equity had invested $63 million into the company to help it grow into a powerful enterprise SaaS platform. I joined a small but scrappy design team, and we set about taking inventory of what design could do to achieve Bitly's mission.</p>

    <p>The homepage of the site, along with all of the marketing materials, hadn't been updated in years. Bitly's products, including a web application, mobile apps, and browser extensions, were suffering from tech debt and the lack of a comprehensive design system. The design team itself had grown 4x and needed new processes and cultural tools to help its growth and maturity.</p>
