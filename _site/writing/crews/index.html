<p>When an Airbus A320 takes off, there are typically 10 people who are operating it. Between the pilots and cabin crew, their responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding how the plane workss</li>
<li>Monitoring the flight’s progress</li>
<li>Evaluating the weather conditions</li>
<li>Communicating with operators on the ground</li>
<li>Communicating with other planes</li>
<li>Educating 100 passengers on safety procedures</li>
<li>Keeping the passengers comfortable</li>
<li>Feeding the passengers on time</li>
<li>Resolving conflicts</li>
<li>Responding to changes in schedule</li>
</ul>
<p>On most flights, this crew is working together for the first time. A given flight’s crew usually didn’t train together. Often, they don’t see the exact plane they need to operate until they step aboard.</p>
<p>In 2017, there were <strong>37,000,000</strong> commercial flights. That year, there were only <strong>151</strong> safety incidents, none of them fatal. That’s a <strong>99.9996%</strong> percent safety record.</p>
<p>How does a group of people who have never met fly 100 people in a 600-metric-ton metal tube across the world so safely?</p>
<p>My best guess:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every Pilot/Co-Pilot/Crew member has the same responsibilities flight-to-flight</li>
<li>Every Airbus A320 is the same</li>
<li><strong>Nobody has to decide where to fly</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-if-crews-had-to-decide-where-to-go%3F">What if crews had to decide where to go?</h2>
<p>The pilot has called a meeting of the crew. The crew discusses various possible destinations. Sure, all the passengers bought tickets to Cleveland, but wouldn’t we make more money if we flew a shorter route instead? The lead crew member has hung a poster in the crew room that says “Move Fast and Break Things,” so they also discuss flying at supersonic speed to Mars. The co-pilot has conducted a survey that says, on average, their passengers would prefer to fly to Fiji. Being equitable, the Pilot puts it to a vote, and Mars wins. Since the plane can’t actually fly to Mars, they agree to research spaceplanes in Q2 instead of flying anywhere.</p>
<p>The crew has made a bold bet on the future of aviation, but has failed to actually fly the plane. The moral?</p>
<h2 id="work-on-teams-like-crews-fly-planes">Work on teams like crews fly planes</h2>
<p>When you work on a team, whether it’s Agile or Scrum, in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Holocracy</a> or <a href="https://www.strategy-business.com/article/00344" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teal Org</a>, or none of the above, your responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding how the team works</li>
<li>Monitoring the team’s progress</li>
<li>Evaluating the current business goals</li>
<li>Communicating outward to the organization</li>
<li>Communicating across to other teams</li>
<li>Educating stakeholders on how the team works</li>
<li>Keeping stakeholders up-to-date</li>
<li>Including stakeholders at the right time</li>
<li>Resolving conflicts</li>
<li>Responding to changing priorities</li>
</ul>
<p>To work productively, make sure you don’t have to decide where to go. Work with stakeholders to set missions, KPIs, OKRs, milestones, or just plain old goals <em>before</em> the team steps foot onto the proverbial plane. In-flight, try to avoid re-evaluating the goal. Land the plane safely with a solid report-out and retrospective, before asking where to go next. Try to make switching teams between projects seamless.</p>
<p>The above advice works for big initiatives, 2-week sprints, and 30-minute meetings — <strong>especially</strong> 30-minute meetings.</p>
