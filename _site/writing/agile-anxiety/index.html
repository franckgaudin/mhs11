<p><strong>Managing anxiety is a big part of my life.</strong></p>
<p>I have generalized anxiety:<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> I constantly feel that <em>something</em> will go wrong at any moment. Often, I can’t even identify what I’m anxious about.</p>
<p>Work is a significant contributor to my anxiety. When I’m at work (and often when I’m not), I enumerate my fears: stakeholder pressure, user feedback, organizational tensions, the list can go on forever.</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve been exploring how designers can work more closely with agile software development teams, and I’ve found something fascinating: agile methodologies mirror strategies for managing anxiety. I’d like to share some of my observations, as well as advice for others who deal with generalized anxiety at work.</p>
<h4 id="side-note%3A-isn%E2%80%99t-agile-for-engineers%3F">Side note: isn’t agile for engineers?</h4>
<p>If you’re reading this, you’ve probably heard of agile software development.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> Our engineering teams work in agile ways, and I’ve been impressed by their commitment to constant improvement.</p>
<p>To make our product development process more efficient, I encourage designers to get embedded with engineering teams: attending planning, standup, and retro enables tighter collaboration.</p>
<p>Based on this close embedding, we’ve also started applying agile principles to our day-to-day design process: continuous delivery, self-organization, and reflection, to name a few. I’m really optimistic about what it will do for our impact on product outcomes.</p>
<p>So how have agile principles helped me manage my anxiety?</p>
<h3 id="agile-reduces-work-in-progress">Agile reduces work in progress</h3>
<p>A work-in-progress limit is often used in agile software development.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup> By enforcing a ceiling on the responsibilities any member of your team has, you reduce multitasking, and increase productivity.</p>
<p>Limiting multitasking and context-switching has had other benefits, too. The less I am accountable for at any given moment, the easier it is for me to manage my anxiety. I can quickly check in to all of my responsibilities, and remind myself that everything’s ok.</p>
<p>Additionally, WIP limits make it easier to do deep, focused work. This is kind of like the runner’s high of product design — I do my best work when I’m “in the zone.”</p>
<h3 id="agile-values-transparency">Agile values transparency</h3>
<p>Although the original <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agile Manifesto</a> and <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supporting principles</a> don’t specifically use the word “transparency,” they get close on this specific note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Standups</strong> (daily check-ins between the working team) provide opportunities to share progress and ask for help. <strong>Sprint reviews</strong> (celebrations of the team’s accomplishments) shine a light on what’s been done. <strong>Retrospectives</strong> (regular conversations around how to improve working processes) are a safe forum for introspection.</p>
<p>All of these things together comprise a support network for the team: anxiety is much easier to manage when you can ask for help when you’re feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<h3 id="agile-focuses-on-the-present">Agile focuses on the present</h3>
<p>One of the biggest sources of my anxiety is the vast expanse of the future. Given enough time, <em>anything</em> can go wrong. This is one of the places where agile methods excel: they focus work only on the present challenges, and embrace the uncertainty of the future.</p>
<p>Our teams work in two-week sprints. Because we’re only focused on delivering within the next few weeks, long-term projects must be broken down into smaller tasks. The “but what if” is handled in one of the principles of agile:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Accepting &amp; acknowledging</em> uncertainty is a big part of managing anxiety. Having this mentality reflected in the team’s working relationships makes it easier to practice.</p>
<h2 id="agile-for-the-anxious">Agile for the anxious</h2>
<p>Agile software development creates a supportive environment for people with anxiety. How do we take advantage of this?</p>
<h3 id="go-to-standup">Go to Standup</h3>
<p>In some ways, standup is like micro-group-therapy. If well-facilitated, it’s an opportunity to check in with responsibilities. Good standups enable me to safely raise concerns, and encourage the team to acknowledge and resolve conflicts.</p>
<p>Standup is sort like meditation for your whole team: regular practice provides focus, making the management of uncertainty a group exercise instead of a solo sport.</p>
<h3 id="turn-off-notifications">Turn off notifications</h3>
<p>The agile process gives you permission to focus. Regularly scheduled, highly structured touch points (planning, standup, retro) mean that you’ll seldom encounter ad-hoc feedback or requests.</p>
<p>I’ve started keeping my phone on ‘do not disturb’ mode for most of the day, and disabling email notifications on my laptop. Initially, this caused me <em>more</em> anxiety: I worried that I was failing to respond to important communication. Eventually, I found that this wasn’t the case. I still have to process emails and slack messages at some point, but I find that most timely requests get resolved naturally.</p>
<h3 id="trust-your-team">Trust your team</h3>
<p>Literature about the agile process uses lots of phrases like “distributed authority,” “self-organization,” and “autonomy.” A major part of the framework is spreading out responsibility as much as possible, and making it easy for the team to quickly flex in support of changes.</p>
<p>Agile software development works best when everyone adopts the distributive approach. It’s been difficult for me to delegate and distribute my work, but as I do, I’ve become far less anxious and more effective at managing a design team.</p>
<h4 id="how-does-your-process-help-with-anxiety%3F">How does your process help with anxiety?</h4>
<p>Have you found processes or workflows that help you manage anxiety? Has your team had any discussions about how you work together to handle uncertainty?</p>
